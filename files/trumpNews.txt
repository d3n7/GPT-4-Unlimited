Donald Trump was arrested in Manhattan and pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to his alleged role in hush money payments. The charges stemmed from an investigation into a 30,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. This marked the first time a former U.S. president has faced criminal charges.
